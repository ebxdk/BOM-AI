Here are coaching scripts designed for managers to use with team members in each of the six capacity states. These scripts help managers address the unique needs of each state, guiding team members to optimize their capacity in purpose, energy, and connection.

1. Depleted State (Low in Purpose, Energy, and Connection)
? Goal: Support recovery by helping the team member regain focus, reduce workload, and prioritize rest.
Script:
"I've noticed that you seem to be running low on energy lately. Let's talk about your current workload and see if there's anything we can adjust or prioritize to help you recharge. Are there tasks that feel especially draining right now? Let's explore ways to streamline your responsibilities and make room for rest and recovery. I want to ensure you have the support you need to feel re-energized."
? Follow-up Action: Identify two to three tasks that can be delegated, postponed, or simplified to reduce stress and create breathing space for the team member.

2. Indulgent State (Low in Purpose; Medium or High in Energy and Connection)
? Goal: Help the team member find meaningful alignment between their work and personal values to increase fulfillment.
Script:
"It sounds like you're doing well with energy and collaboration, which is fantastic! I'd love to discuss your long-term goals and see if there are ways to connect your work with what feels meaningful to you. Are there areas in your role where you'd like to focus more on what matters most to you? Let's explore options that bring a sense of purpose to your tasks so that you feel even more fulfilled in your work."
? Follow-up Action: Work together to identify one or two projects or responsibilities that align better with the team member's values or areas of interest.

3. Fatigued State (Low in Energy; Medium or High in Purpose and Connection)
? Goal: Help the team member manage workload, balance energy, and support sustainable performance.
Script:
"I can see that you're very dedicated to your work, and I want to make sure you have the energy to sustain it. Let's take a look at your current tasks and see if we can create more balance. Are there particular projects that are taking more energy than expected? I want to help you prioritize tasks in a way that allows for both progress and recovery. Let's create a plan to make your workload feel more manageable."
? Follow-up Action: Identify energy-draining tasks and strategize to balance the workload, possibly by scheduling breaks or redistributing responsibilities.

4. Reserved State (Low in Connection; Medium or High in Purpose and Energy)
? Goal: Encourage social connection and foster teamwork to support resilience and engagement.
Script:
"I've noticed that you work very independently, which is a great strength. I also know that strong connections can make work more enjoyable and supportive. Let's brainstorm ways to build connections within the team. Are there any areas where you'd like to collaborate more, or are there projects where we could bring in more teamwork? Strengthening connections can bring new ideas and support, making challenging tasks feel a bit lighter."
? Follow-up Action: Discuss opportunities for collaboration or team projects that align with the team member's strengths and interests, creating a more supportive environment.

5. Sustained State (Medium to High in all areas)
? Goal: Maintain balance by encouraging reflection, adaptability, and continuous growth.
Script:
"You're doing a great job maintaining balance and keeping up with your work. I'd love to talk about ways we can keep this momentum going. Are there any areas where you'd like more support or new challenges that could help you grow further? It's also helpful to keep reflecting on what's working well to stay adaptable. Let's make sure you have the right tools to keep things balanced while building on your strengths."
? Follow-up Action: Set up regular check-ins for reflection, discuss new growth opportunities, and ensure the team member feels supported in maintaining their balance.

6. Maximized State (High in Purpose, Energy, and Connection)
? Goal: Support sustainable high performance, prevent overextension, and maintain alignment with goals.
Script:
"I can see that you're operating at a high level right now, and your contributions are incredibly valuable. I want to make sure you have the support to keep this momentum in a sustainable way. Are there any areas where you feel stretched or close to overcommitting? Let's also talk about long-term goals to ensure your work continues to feel purposeful. I want to help you stay at your best while avoiding burnout."
? Follow-up Action: Together, assess current commitments to ensure they're manageable and meaningful, preventing overextension while supporting peak performance.

These scripts are designed to guide managers in holding thoughtful, supportive conversations with team members based on their capacity state. They balance active listening with practical follow-up actions, helping team members address specific needs and optimize their well-being and productivity.
