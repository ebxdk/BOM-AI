The 3x3 capacity matrix is a useful tool for individuals to focus their roles, align their goals and
measure success. This helps maintain focus in key areas while also providing a clear framework
for assessing performance and success in a structured way.

When to Use: If individuals or teams feel their work lack significance or alignment with personal or
organizational objectives, or when individuals or teams feel unclear about their
direction or significance of their work.

Benefits: Reinstates a sense of purpose and direction through aligning roles and goals wth

broader organizational missions and/or career aspirations. This provides a
structured path for purposeful action, reigniting motivation and a sense of direction.

Instructions:
Identify Top Three Roles: Reflect on your current professional landscape and identify the three
roles you primarily occupy. These roles should reflect your major responsibilities or the areas
where you spend most of your time.
List Associated Goals: For each role, list the primary goals you aim to achieve. These goals should
be specific, measurable, achievable and time-bound.
Define Controls: For each goal, define a controlâ€”a specific statement or metric that proves your
success in achieving the goal. This could be a performance metric, a completed project, or a
significant achievement.
