The 3x3 capacity matrix is a useful tool for individuals to focus their roles , align their goals and
measure success. This helps maintain focus in key areas while also providing a clear framework
for assessing performance and success in a structured way.

When to Use: When there is a noticeable drop in motivation, enthusiasm, or general productivity
within an individual.

Benefits: Assists individuals and teams in setting clear goals, enabling them to see a direct
connection between their efforts and outcomes. This can enhance morale and
motivation. The matrix prioritizes tasks that have the greatest impact, helping to
prevent burnout and conserve energy for what truly matters.

Instructions:
Identify Top Three Roles: Reflect on your current professional landscape and identify the three
roles you primarily occupy as it relates to your energy. These roles should reflect your major
responsibilities or the areas where you spend most of your time.
List Associated Goals: For each role, list the primary goals you aim to achieve. These goals should
be specific, measurable, achievable and time-bound.
Define Controls: For each goal, define a controlâ€”a specific statement or metric that proves your
success in achieving the goal. This could be a performance metric, a completed project, or a
significant achievement.
