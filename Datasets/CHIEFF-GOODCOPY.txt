Resource Tool:

Capacity Audit
When to use: Implement the CHIEFF method during quarterly reviews, team-building sessions,
performance evaluations, mid-year check-ins, high-stress periods, and career
development discussions to reassess and realign commitments.

Benefits: Helps employees gain a clear understanding of how their time and energy are

distributed across key life areas, leading to better capacity management and
improved alignment with personal values. It enhances self-awareness and
motivation by encouraging reflection on purpose and well-being. Additionally, it
creates a supportive and sustainable work environment that prevents burnout and
promotes overall productivity and satisfaction.
