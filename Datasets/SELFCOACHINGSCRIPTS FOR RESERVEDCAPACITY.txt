SELF COACHING SCRIPTS FOR RESERVED CAPACITY 
1. Script for Identifying and Overcoming Social Barriers -
? Purpose: Help individuals reflect on and recognize any internal or external barriers preventing them from connecting with others.
Script:
"Reflecting on my social interactions, are there any beliefs or fears that might be keeping me from opening up to others? Do I sometimes assume others might not understand me, or worry they won't value my input? How could I challenge these beliefs to create more space for connection? I'll remind myself that connection begins with openness and that others may feel similarly. Letting go of these fears could bring positive relationships into my life."
? Follow-up Action: Write down one small step to challenge this barrier, such as initiating a conversation with a colleague or sharing something personal with a friend.

2. Script for Building Confidence in Communicating Needs
? Purpose: Support individuals in expressing their social and emotional needs clearly, helping to foster genuine connections.
Script:
"What specific support or interaction am I looking for in my relationships? When I think about my needs, am I comfortable sharing them? If I feel hesitant, I can start small by expressing my needs clearly in safe and supportive relationships. For example, 'I'd really appreciate your support with...' or 'It would mean a lot if we could...' I don't need to expect perfection from myself or others; building meaningful relationships takes time and practice."
? Follow-up Action: Choose one specific interaction to practice sharing a need openly.

3. Script for Creating Opportunities to Connect
? Purpose: Encourage taking active steps to connect and engage with others, even when busy or feeling uncertain.
Script:
"Am I prioritizing connection in my life? Sometimes, taking small steps to connect, even when I feel busy, can help nurture relationships. I'll consider simple ways to reach out, whether it's a quick check-in with a colleague, joining a work event, or scheduling time with a friend. I'll remind myself that building connection doesn't require large gestures-consistent, small interactions create meaningful bonds over time."
? Follow-up Action: Write down one or two connection-building actions to take this week, like texting a friend or attending a social gathering.

4. Script for Vulnerability and Trust in Relationships
? Purpose: Support individuals in embracing vulnerability to deepen trust and authenticity in relationships.
Script:
"What would it look like if I let myself be a bit more open and vulnerable in my relationships? I know that sharing something personal can feel risky, but it can also create trust and authenticity. If I let others see parts of me that I normally keep private, they may feel encouraged to share in return. I'll remember that vulnerability is a strength-it invites deeper, more genuine connections."
? Follow-up Action: Think of one trusted person and plan a conversation where you share something meaningful or personal, creating space for mutual openness.

5. Script for Active Listening and Empathy in Conversations
? Purpose: Foster deeper connections by focusing on listening and empathy during interactions.
Script:
"Am I fully present in my conversations with others? I'll aim to listen actively and empathetically, allowing others to feel heard and valued. When someone shares something with me, I can respond with, 'I hear you, and I understand why that's important to you,' or ask open questions to learn more about their experience. Building a habit of listening without judgment strengthens relationships and shows my genuine interest in them."
? Follow-up Action: During the next few conversations, practice active listening by focusing on the other person's words and showing empathy through verbal and non-verbal cues.

6. Script for Setting Intentions to Nurture Relationships
? Purpose: Encourage consistency in building connections by setting specific relationship goals.
Script:
"Are there relationships in my life that I'd like to nurture or strengthen? I'll think of one or two people with whom I'd like to deepen my connection. By setting an intention to be more present and engaged with them, I can create meaningful bonds. I'll decide on simple, actionable ways to show up for them-whether it's checking in regularly, showing appreciation, or planning quality time together. Consistency in small acts of connection is how relationships grow."
? Follow-up Action: List two people you'd like to connect with more and write down one action per person to nurture these relationships.

7. Script for Overcoming Fear of Rejection
? Purpose: Address fear of rejection that may prevent individuals from forming connections.
Script:
"Do I sometimes hold back from reaching out because I fear rejection? I can remind myself that while not every interaction will lead to a deep connection, reaching out opens doors. I'll try to see connection-building as a practice, not a test. Each interaction is an opportunity to grow my comfort in connecting, regardless of the outcome. Reaching out and engaging in connection is valuable in itself."
? Follow-up Action: Identify one relationship where fear of rejection has held you back and make a plan to initiate a simple, low-stakes connection, like a friendly check-in.

8. Script for Building Trust Through Follow-Through
? Purpose: Reinforce the importance of consistency and reliability to build trust with others.
Script:
"Am I following through on commitments in my relationships? Building trust comes from showing others that they can rely on me. If I say I'll do something, I'll make it a priority to follow through, no matter how small the commitment. Trust builds with each consistent action, and it's worth the effort to become someone others can count on."
? Follow-up Action: Reflect on any pending promises or commitments, then make an effort to fulfill them to reinforce trust.

9. Script for Addressing Conflict with Openness
? Purpose: Encourage open, honest communication when conflicts arise to prevent isolation.
Script:
"When conflict arises, do I feel comfortable addressing it openly? Instead of avoiding tough conversations, I'll practice speaking openly and respectfully about my feelings. I can start with 'I feel...' statements to express my emotions without placing blame. Resolving conflicts honestly can deepen understanding and strengthen the relationship. Healthy connections require open dialogue, even when it's challenging."
? Follow-up Action: Reflect on any unresolved conflicts and plan to initiate an honest conversation to address them in a constructive way.

10. Script for Evaluating Relationship Health
? Purpose: Encourage self-reflection on the quality of connections and how they impact well-being.
Script:
"Are the relationships in my life supportive and fulfilling? I'll take a moment to reflect on which relationships add positivity and which may drain my energy. I'll ask myself if I feel valued, understood, and supported. If certain relationships consistently feel unsupportive or draining, I might need to set boundaries or reprioritize them. A healthy support network nourishes my well-being and resilience."
? Follow-up Action: List supportive relationships to prioritize, as well as any relationships that may need boundaries or re-evaluation.
